                <h6 class="text-muted text-center">POSTED ON<a href="#">JANUARY 20, 2021</a> BY <a href="#">JOFEGAN</a></h6><br><br>
                <h6>The Proprietor and Head, Business Development & Growth of Jofegan International School (JIS) is Jonah Sheshi Suman Gana. Professionally, he is a multi-Disciplinary Consultant; a Chartered Accountant (ACA), Registered Architect (MNIA), Human and Business Development Consultant, Development and Governance Specialist and a retired Military Officer.<br><br> 

                    EDUCATION<br><br> 
                    
                    Wing Commander JS Gana (Rtd) attended St Matthews Primary School Gbadafu in Gbako Local Government Area of Niger State. He had his secondary education at the famous Government College Bida after which he proceeded to School of Basic Studies, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) for his ‘A’ levels.

Thereafter, he enrolled at The University of Jos for His Postgraduate Diploma in Management (PDGM). Furthermore, he was at the University of Benin for his Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) Programme, University of Lagos, Consultancy Services Unit for his computer Appreciation Course and The Federal Polytechnic Bida Accountancy certification. He is currently rounding off his education with the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) where he has the Postgraduate Diploma in Education in view.<br><br> 
                    
                    In addition to these civil courses in conventional universities, he also attended many military courses including the Command and Staff College Jaji where he was the best graduating Officer of his course (course 34/92).<br><br> 
                    
                    CAREER PATH<br><br> 
                    
                    In addition to being the proprietor of JIS, Wing Commander JS Gana is presently the Chief Executive Officer of Jofegan Group, comprising of Jofegan Consulting Ltd – a Human and Business Development Consultant and Jofegan Integrated Farms. Wing Commander JS Gana (Rtd) has the privilege to have worked in all tiers of Government in Nigeria – Local, State and Federal Governments. He also worked as a consultant with many International Development Partners including World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Kingdom Department of International Development (UK-DFID), European Union (EU), UNICEF, German Technical Cooperation in Nigeria (GIZ), among others.<br><br>  
                    
                    Specifically, he was a Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Trainer and Coach with the Pro Poor Growth and Promotion of Employment (SEDIN) Programme; GIZ-SEDIN German Technical Cooperation in Nigeria. Before that, he was the Niger State Partnership Coordinator with the Engaged Citizens Programme of the Partnership to Engage Reform and Lean (ECP-PERL) and Niger State Team Leader of State Accountability and Voice Initiative (SAVI); both Voice and Accountability programmes aimed at strengthening systems, processes and procedure for public/citizens’ participation in government decision-making and the development process generally. During his course of duty, he worked closely with Niger State House of Assembly, The Media, Civil Society Organizations and Niger State Planning Commission, making modest achievements. Both programmes were UK-DFID sponsored/financed.
                    <br><br> 
                    During the course of his career, he was a National Consultant to National Planning Commission where he was actively involved in developing and benchmarking the States’ Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy Documents (SEEDS). The benchmarking exercise was a governance peer review exercise among Nigerian States. The SEEDS benchmarking exercise was sponsored by the World Bank, UNDP, DFID, and EU. Furthermore, he was privileged to be a consultant to the Universal Basic Education Programme where he was involved in the enumeration of Primary school teachers in Nigeria. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Architect Gana also served as Vice Chairman of Gbako Local Government; worked as Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Executive Governor of Niger State on Economic Planning; engaged by The Presidency to providing technical assistance to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Millennium Development Goals (OSSAP-MDGs). Before these, he started his career as an Architect with the Niger State Government rising to the position of Senior Architect before transferring his services to the Nigerian Airforce (Ministry of Defence) where he retired voluntarily, in 2001, with the rank of Wing Commander.
                    <br><br> 
                    At the Nigerian Airforce, he served in many Units and Commands. These are at Jos, Benin, Kaduna, Lagos and Abuja where he voluntarily retired to go into full time consultancy.
                    <br><br> 
                    MOTIVATION FOR ESTABLISHING JOFEGAN INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL BIDA
                    <br><br> 
                    The dream and desire to establish a high quality school came to him when he was with the Nigerian Airforce Military School (AFMS) Jos. He observed then, that pupils who sat for the AFMS entrance examination from Nupe land (Bida and environs in particular) hardly make it on merit. After some research to find out the reasons for this, it was concluded that the lack of schools of high standards that can compete with schools from other parts of the country was the bane. The decision to establish a high quality school at Bida was then born.
                    <br><br> 
                    With his high passion for education and excellent love of children, the seed of Jofegan International School (JIS) was sown in September 2008. God watered it and after 10 years, we can look back and acknowledge God’s faithfully. Modest achievements have been made including representing Niger State in many competitions. The joy is that students of JIS are now admitted into AFMS on merit.
                    <br><br> 
                    JIS is therefore not an accident but a product of many years of planning.  Parents who have their ward(s) in JIS or who desire to bring their children to the school have made or about to make the best investment they can ever think of for their wards. There is no doubt that your ward will be given an educational experience of unparalleled Depth and Scope. At JIS we can never compromise the academic, safety, health and wellbeing of our wards. Parents who allow us to contribute to the development of their wards will have nothing to regret. There wards are in safe hands.
                    <br><br> 
                    Dear Parents, our emphasis on developing the total man and ensuring that we give nothing but the best has made us to excel in all competitions and external examinations we engage in. This has brought in over 20 awards within the short period of our existence. Three of these awards will suffice for mention here:
                    <br><br> 
                    First Position in Niger State in NNPC Science Quiz competition enabling us to represent Niger State at the National Level
                    First position in Junior Scientists Competition; also representing Niger State at the National level where we came 9th.
                    Represented Niger State at the Science Olympiad Competition taking 3rd position in Chemistry at the National level.
                    Register your Ward/Child in any of our schools in the Six Locations in Niger State.
